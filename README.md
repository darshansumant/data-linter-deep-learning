## Data
For this project, a good place to start are a few of the Kaggle competitions. Some of the datasets we propose testing on are detailed below. We will select one sparse dataset (the GTD) and one rare-event dataset (the Credit Card Fraud dataset):
1. Predicting Casualties in Terror Attacks - The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is a very sparse database, which we hypothesize could benefit greatly from applications of the Data Linter - https://www.kaggle.com/mm5631/eda-predicting-casualties-in-terror-attacks/
2. One of the key test cases for measuring the usability of the Data Linter would also be to test performance on datasets with a very low prior / rare-event detection such as Credit Card Fraud - https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
